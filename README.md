# route-planning

A collection of route planning algorithms for road networks.

This collection contains different route planning techniques from a lecture I'm currently taking. As for now the collection contains:

* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Bidirectional version of Dijkstra's Algorithm

This repository contains a CLI program to execute those techniques on an input graph file. The help can be displayed with:

```sh
go run ./ --help
```

Example input graph files can be taken from <http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml> or <https://networkrepository.com/road.php>.
